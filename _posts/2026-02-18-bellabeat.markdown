description: "For this case study, I analyzed smart device fitness data to unlock growth opportunities for Bellabeat. Key highlights include:<br><br>
  • <b>The Nighttime Gap:</b> Identified that 73% of users stop logging data after 10 PM, suggesting a need for automated sleep tracking or better battery alerts.<br>
  • <b>Tools Used:</b> Processed over 30,000 rows of data using R (Tidyverse) and created visualizations with ggplot2.<br>
  • <b>Outcome:</b> Recommended a 'Low Power' mode and evening push notifications to increase user engagement during the 'Nighttime Gap'.<br><br>
