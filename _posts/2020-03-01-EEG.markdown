description: "Peer-reviewed research published in the <b>Student Conference Proceedings 2020</b> (ISBN: 978-3945954621), focusing on lean hardware optimization for neural research.<br><br>
  • <b>Protocol Engineering:</b> Designed a specialized setup and data acquisition protocol to record <b>Event-Related Potentials (ERP)</b> using a single-lead <b>biosignalsplux</b> EEG sensor.<br>
  • <b>Technical Enablement:</b> Created a comprehensive <b>Jupyter Python Notebook</b> to guide users through the full pipeline: from precise sensor positioning to signal filtering and P300 wave detection.<br>
  • <b>Signal Innovation:</b> Proved the viability of minimal-channel setups for detecting cognitive responses, significantly lowering the barrier for mobile neuro-research."
